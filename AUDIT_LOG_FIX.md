# Audit Log Validation Fix

## Issue Description
The application was experiencing repeated validation errors when trying to create audit logs:
```
AuditLog validation failed: action: `DATA_UPDATED` is not a valid enum value for path `action`.
```

## Root Cause
The audit middleware (`middleware/auditMiddleware.js`) was generating generic action types like `DATA_UPDATED`, `DATA_CREATED`, and `DATA_DELETED` as fallback actions for HTTP methods that didn't match specific routes. However, these generic action types were not included in the enum validation list in the AuditLog model (`models/AuditLog.js`).

## Solution
Added the missing generic action types to the AuditLog model enum:

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated AuditLog.js** - Added generic data actions to the enum:
   ```javascript
   // Generic data actions (fallback for middleware)
   'DATA_CREATED', 'DATA_UPDATED', 'DATA_DELETED',
   ```

2. **Updated auditMiddleware.js** - Updated the `determineCategory` function to properly categorize these generic actions:
   ```javascript
   const dataActions = ['INVENTORY_CREATED', 'DELIVERY_CREATED', 'WAREHOUSE_CREATED', 'DATA_CREATED', 'DATA_UPDATED', 'DATA_DELETED'];
   ```

## Result
- ✅ Audit log validation errors are completely resolved
- ✅ Server starts and runs without validation warnings
- ✅ Audit logging continues to work for all HTTP requests
- ✅ Both specific and generic action types are properly logged

## Testing
- Server starts without errors
- API requests are processed normally
- Rate limiting is working as expected
- No validation errors in server logs
