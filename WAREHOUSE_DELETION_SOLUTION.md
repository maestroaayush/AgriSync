# Warehouse Inventory Deletion Issue - SOLVED

## Problem
The delete functionality works from the farmer dashboard but not from the warehouse dashboard.

## Root Cause
The issue is caused by **JWT token caching**. When a user's role is updated in the database (e.g., from `farmer` to `warehouse_manager`), their existing JWT token still contains the old role. The backend permission checks use the role from the JWT token, not the database.

## How JWT Tokens Work
1. When a user logs in, a JWT token is created with their current role
2. This token is stored in the browser's localStorage
3. The token contains: `{ id: "user_id", role: "farmer" }`
4. When the user's role is updated in the database to `warehouse_manager`, the token still says `farmer`
5. The backend checks permissions using the token's role, not the database role

## Solution

### For Users
**The user must log out and log back in after their role is changed to warehouse manager.**

1. Admin assigns user as warehouse manager
2. User logs out (clears old token)
3. User logs back in (gets new token with `warehouse_manager` role)
4. Delete/Edit functionality now works

### For Developers (Optional Enhancement)
To avoid requiring users to log out/in after role changes, you could:

1. **Option A: Force Re-authentication**
   - When admin changes a user's role, invalidate their current session
   - Force them to log in again

2. **Option B: Dynamic Role Checking**
   - Instead of storing role in JWT, only store user ID
   - Look up the user's role from database on each request
   - (This adds database overhead but ensures role is always current)

3. **Option C: Token Refresh on Role Change**
   - Implement a token refresh mechanism
   - When role changes, notify the client to refresh their token

## Testing Steps

1. **Check current user status:**
   ```bash
   # Login as the user
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email":"farmer@test.com","password":"password123"}'
   ```

2. **If the returned role is not `warehouse_manager`, the user needs to:**
   - Clear browser localStorage (removes old token)
   - Log in again
   - The new token will have the correct role

3. **Verify in the browser:**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Go to Application/Storage → Local Storage
   - Clear the `token` entry
   - Log in again
   - Check that user object shows `role: "warehouse_manager"`

## Current System Status

✅ **Backend**: Permission checks are properly configured
✅ **Frontend**: Delete/Edit modals and handlers are implemented
✅ **Database**: User roles can be updated
❌ **Token**: Old tokens retain old roles until user logs in again

## Quick Fix for Testing

If you're testing and need to quickly fix this:

1. Open browser console
2. Run: `localStorage.clear()`
3. Refresh the page
4. Log in again with the warehouse manager credentials
5. The delete/edit buttons should now work

## Conclusion

The system is working correctly. The issue is that **JWT tokens are immutable** - once created, they can't be changed. Users must get a new token (by logging in again) after their role changes.
